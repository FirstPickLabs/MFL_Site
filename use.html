                      limited to various predefined file size values. If you
                      abuse the system to exceed a reasonable amount of disk
                      space for your league, FPL has the right to suspend and
                      terminate your account and your league.

                          you shall institute operational backup procedures to
                          manually accommodate these users. You shall not hold
