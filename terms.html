                    <p>
                      First Pick Labs, Inc. (&quot;FPL&quot;) provides the
                      MyFantasyLeague.com Fantasy Football Commissioner Service
                      (the “Service”) as defined below to you subject to the
                      following terms of service (“TOS”). First Pick Labs
                      reserves the right to make additions, revisions, and
                      modifications to these terms at any time. It is therefore
                      important for you to periodically refer to our TOS (this
                      page) for the most current version. By continuing to use
                      the Site following such modifications, you agree to comply
                      with this Agreement (the “Agreement”) and to be bound by
                      any such modifications to the TOS.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Description of Service</h5>
                    <p>
                      First Pick Labs offers a web-based league management
                      system for you to use in order to manage a fantasy
                      football league on the World Wide Web of the Internet at
                      http://home.myfantasyleague.com (the “Site”, “MFL”). In
                      addition to the core features offered by FPL, this Service
                      may include information and features from third-party
                      partners of FPL. You acknowledge and agree that you must:
                      (a) provide for your own access to the World Wide Web and
                      pay any service fees associated with such access, and (b)
                      provide all equipment necessary for you to make such
                      connection to the World Wide Web, including a computer and
                      modem or other access device.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Copyright</h5>
                    <p>
                      All information, content, software, design, text, images,
                      photographs, illustrations, audio clips, video clips,
                      artwork, graphic material, or other copyrightable elements
                      displayed on, transmitted through, or used in connection
                      with site, and the selection and arrangements thereof, and
                      trademarks, service marks and trade names (the “Material”)
                      are the property of FPL or other respective owners and are
                      protected, without limitation, pursuant to U.S. and
                      foreign copyright, trademark and other applicable laws.
                      FPL hereby grants you a personal, non-exclusive,
                      non-assignable and non-transferable license to use and
                      display the Material for noncommercial and personal use
                      only provided that you maintain all copyright and other
                      notices contained in such Material. In accepting these
                      TOS, you agree not to reproduce, modify, create derivative
                      works from, display, perform, publish, distribute,
                      disseminate, broadcast or circulate any Material to any
                      third party (including, without limitation, the display
                      and distribution of the Material via a third party
                      website) without the express prior written consent of FPL.
                      You may not distribute any Material to others, whether or
                      not for payment or other consideration, and you may not
                      modify, copy, cache, reproduce, sell, publish, transmit,
                      display or otherwise use any portion of the Material. You
                      may not screen scrape or otherwise copy our Material
                      without permission. You agree not to decompile, reverse
                      engineer or disassemble any software or other products or

                      federal and state laws.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Outbound Links to Third Party Sites</h5>
                    <p>
                      When you are on MFL, you could be directed to other web
                      sites that are beyond our control as there are links to
                      other sites from MFL pages that take you outside of our
                      service. For example, if you click on the
                      FantasySharks.com link on the Submit Lineup page you will
                      be taken to a non-MFL site. This may include links to
                      partners, affiliates, and content providers that may use
                      our logo(s) as part of a co-branding relationship. You
                      acknowledge that when you click on a link that leaves MFL,
                      the site you will land on is not controlled by FPL and
                      different terms of use and privacy policy may apply. By
                      clicking on links to other sites, you acknowledge that FPL
                      is not responsible for those sites. FPL also reserves the
                      right to disable links from third-party sites to any MFL
                      page, although we are under no obligation to do so. In
                      addition, the Service allows customers to add outbound
                      links to other sites on the Internet. As FPL has no
                      control over such sites and resources, you acknowledge and
                      agree that FPL is not responsible for the availability of
                      such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and
                      is not responsible or liable for any Content, advertising,
                      products, or other materials on or available from such
                      sites or resources. You further acknowledge and agree that
                      FPL shall not be responsible or liable, directly or
                      indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be
                      caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any
                      such Content, goods or services available on or through
                      any such site or resource.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Customer Content</h5>
                    <p>
                      FPL permits you to upload information, advice, text, data,
                      software, messages and other materials to the Site
                      (“Customer Content”). Customer Content is your sole
                      responsibility. This means that you, and not FPL, are
                      entirely responsible for all of Customer Content that you
                      upload, post, e-mail, transmit or otherwise make available
                      via the Service. FPL cannot ensure the security of any
                      information you post on publicly available areas of the
                      Service. Under no circumstances will we be liable in any
                      way for any of Customer Content including, but not limited
                      to, any errors or omissions in Customer Content, or for
                      any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the
                      use of any of Customer Content made available via the
                      Service. FPL does not claim ownership of Customer Content.
                      However, you hereby grant us a world-wide, royalty-free,
                      non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully
                      sub-licensable right and license to use, reproduce,
                      modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works
                      from, distribute, perform, and display Customer Content
                      and to incorporate Customer Content in other works in any
                      form, media, or technology now known or later developed.
                      You acknowledge that we do not pre-screen Customer
                      Content, but that we have the right, but not the
                      obligation, in our sole discretion to modify, transmit
                      over various networks, refuse or move any of Customer
                      Content that is available on the Service. You agree that
                      you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the
                      use of any of Customer Content including, but not limited
                      to, any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or
                      usefulness of Customer Content. You acknowledge and agree
                      that FPL may archive Customer Content and may also
                      disclose Customer Content at any time and for any reason.
                      Since we do not pre-screen user generated content, you may
                      be exposed to content that is offensive, indecent, or
                      objectionable.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Submissons</h5>
                    <p>
                      Any material (e.g., email, posting to our support boards)
                      you send us, solicited or unsolicited, including, but not
                      limited to creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts,
                      or other information (collectively, the “Submissions”),
                      the Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, our
                      property. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any
                      obligation of confidentiality on our part and we shall not
                      be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions.
                      Without limitation of the foregoing, we shall exclusively
                      own all now-known or hereafter existing rights to the
                      Submissions of every kind and nature throughout the
                      universe and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the
                      Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or
                      otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the
                      Submissions or any other person or entity.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Indemnification</h5>
                    <p>
                      You agree to indemnify and hold FPL, its affiliates,
                      partners, contractors, vendors, officers, directors and
                      employees harmless from any claim, action, demand, loss,
                      or damages (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) made or
                      incurred by any third party arising out of or relating to
                      your use of the Service.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h5>
                    <p>
                      Sure, here is the content with all caps removed: --- You
                      expressly understand and agree that your use of the
                      service is at your sole risk. The service is provided on
                      an “as is” and “as available” basis. FPL expressly
                      disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or
                      implied, including, but not limited to the implied
                      warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
                      purpose and non-infringement. FPL, its owners and
                      employees, its content providers, partners, and vendors
                      and any of their employees shall not be held responsible
                      for errors or omissions pertaining to the accuracy and
                      reliability of any of the information related to the
                      service. FPL reserves the right to take down the site for
                      periodic maintenance and upgrades, and depending on
                      circumstances may not inform customers in advance of any
                      such downtime. FPL also reserves the right to remove any
                      historical league information including, but not limited
                      to, polls, articles, and message board posts at its sole
                      discretion. Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained
                      through the use of the service is done at your own
                      discretion and risk and that you will be solely
                      responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss
                      of data that results from the download of any such
                      material. No advice or information, whether oral or
                      written, obtained by you from FPL or through or from the
                      service shall create any warranty not expressly stated in
                      the TOS. You expressly understand and agree that FPL shall
                      not be liable to you for any direct, indirect, incidental,
                      special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but
                      not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill,
                      use, data or other intangible losses (even if FPL has been
                      advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting
                      from: (i) the use or the inability to use the service;
                      (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and
                      services resulting from any goods, data, information or
                      services purchased or obtained or messages received or
                      transactions entered into through or from the service;
                      (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your
                      transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any
                      third party on the service; or (v) any other matter
                      relating to the service. Some states do not allow the
                      exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
                      damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not
                      apply to you. In no event shall FPL&rsquo;s total
                      liability to you for all damages, losses, or causes of
                      action exceed the purchase price of the product.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Jurisdiction and Governing Law</h5>
                    <p>
                      This agreement, and the application or interpretation of
                      this agreement, shall be governed exclusively by its terms
                      and in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas
                      without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and
                      FPL agree to submit to the personal and exclusive
                      jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of

                    <h5>Termination</h5>
                    <p>
                      FPL at any time may terminate this Agreement with or
                      without cause. You may terminate this agreement by
                      submitting a written request to FPL. A full refund will be
                      offered for any reason through the scheduled kickoff of
                      the fourth week of NFL games. A partial refund will never
                      be offered under any circumstances. Regardless of which
                      party terminates the Agreement, the Service may be
                      immediately suspended or disabled, without notice. In the
                      event of either a suspension or termination of the Service
                      to you, FPL shall not be held responsible for any
                      consequences pertaining to lack of access to the Service.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Miscellaneous</h5>
                    <p>
                      The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and
                      FPL regarding your use of the Service from which you
                      accessed this Agreement and governs your use of the
                      Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and
                      FPL with respect to the Service. FPL may modify this
                      Agreement periodically without notice. If any provision of
                      this Agreement is determined invalid, all other provisions
                      will remain in effect as fully valid.
